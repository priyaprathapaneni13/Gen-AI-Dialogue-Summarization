In this project, I implemented a dialogue summarization task using generative AI. The focus was on exploring how input text impacts model outputs and leveraging prompt engineering techniques to guide the model towards the desired task. I compared the performance of zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inference approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt engineering in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
